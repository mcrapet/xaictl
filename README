SteelSeries XAI Mouse configuration tool (for Linux)

It is written in C using libusb-1.0 (stable API).

Vendor specific protocol has been reversed with the help of DebugFS and
USBMon and.. VirtualBox! It was tested with firmware 1.4.2.

1. Access to hardware

You'll need root access for the first time : interface 2 of mouse is taken
by kernel usbhid driver and must unbinded. It's done by this software but
you'll need rights. Look for "hid unbind" in Google..

1.1 Setup udev for user access

# cat /etc/udev/rules.d/90-xai.rules
ATTRS{idVendor}=="1038", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1360", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'echo -n $id:1.2 >/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind'"
# /etc/init.d/udev restart

2. Software limitations

* No macro entry
* Handle left/right hand mode flag

3. Known issues

* Message read and message write functions are not reliable.
  Sometimes you must execute the command 2 times for real write.

4. Ideas

* Modify several profiles at once.
